//  RULES

// 1   Variable names can consist only of letters (a-z), numbers (0-9),
//     dollar sign symbols ($), and underscores (_)

// 2   Variable names cannot contain any whitespace characters (tabs or spaces)

// 3   Numbers cannot begin the name of any variable

// 4   There are several reserved keywords which cannot be used as the name of a variable

// 5   Variable names are case sensitive

// JavaScript also has the convention of using camel case
// (sometimes stylized as camelCase) in the names of function
// and variables declared with var or let.

let thisVariable = null;

function testFuntion() {
  console.log(thisVariable);
}

// The names of variables that are constant, declared with the const keyword,
// are typically written in all uppercase.

const CONSTANT = 3.14;
